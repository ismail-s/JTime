    <h2>Help</h2>
    <p>This website allows you to view masjid jamaat times, as well as add/change
      the times. If anyone makes any changes, then everyone sees the new
      version. It's a bit like editing wikipedia in that way.</p>
    <p>There is an
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ismail_s.jtime.android">Android app</a>
      available on the Play Store. It does the same job as this website, but is
      a lot more developed.</p>
    <p>This website is a work in progress, so a lot of features aren't available
      yet. If you have any ideas/improvements/issues, please open an issue on
      <a href="https://www.github.com/ismail-s/jtime/issues">Github</a>.</p>
