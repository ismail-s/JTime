See local masjid jamaat times on the move, with jamaat times submitted in-app by anyone.

This is a REST API along with an Android app that connects to it. I don't have a mac, so am not focussing on an iPhone app until everything else is up and running. If/when that happens, as this is currently a solo project, and I do not have all the time in the world to work on this.

*Currently WIP.*
