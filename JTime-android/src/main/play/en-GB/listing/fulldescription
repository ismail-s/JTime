See jamaat times for local masjids. All jamaat times are added/changed within this app, and anyone can change any jamaat time.

This app is free and open-source, see https://www.github.com/ismail-s/jtime . Feel free to contribute in whatever way.

There is a website available at https://jtime.ismail-s.com . This does the same job as this app, but can be used on any device.

I have tried hard to make the app and website look nice and work well, without wasting your time clicking on lots of buttons to see jamaat times. If you have any ideas, or want to help improve it, please create an issue at https://www.github.com/ismail-s/jtime .

Note that I am not planning on making an iPhone app, see https://developer.apple.com/programs/how-it-works/.

<b>Permissions</b>

&#8226; Internet access (pretty obvious why that's needed)
&#8226; Location (to show nearby times & sort masjids by distance)

<b>Privacy Policy</b>

By using this app, I may get your email address and approximate location. I am not going to share these with anyone, and will do my best to keep this information secure (tbh I doubt I'll even look at any of this info). Seriously. I won't even send you emails or sell your emails to spammers or whatever. Anyways, all the code is at https://github.com/ismail-s/jtime .

<b>Alternative apps</b>

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.masjid.timetable (submit jamaat times as an Excel spreadsheet on a computer)
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acs.mymosque (masjids need to submit times themselves. Seems to be more commercial in nature)
