See jamaat times for local masjids. All jamaat times are added/changed within this app, and anyone can change any jamaat time.

This app is free and open-source, see https://www.github.com/ismail-s/jtime . Feel free to contribute in whatever way.

I plan to add more features, see https://waffle.io/ismail-s/JTime for more details. Note that I am not planning on making an iPhone app, as I'd have to pay them $99 a year (I'm not joking, see https://developer.apple.com/programs/how-it-works/ ).
